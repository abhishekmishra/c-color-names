**0.1.0-alpha.0**  2022-12-18 Abhishek Mishra  <abhishekmishra3@gmail.com>

- This is the first alpha release of the `c-color-names` library. The program has been around for some time as it is used in some of my hobby projects.
- The goal of the program is to provide a simple C API to the color names defined in the nodejs project [color-names](https://github.com/meodai/color-names).
- Specifically for now it exposes the color names defined in **color-names/dist/colornames.bestof.csv**.
- The API documentation is provided in `color_names.h`.
- The API is provisional-only for now, and there may be breaking changes in the coming releases.
- Once the API is considered stable I will make a **beta** release.
